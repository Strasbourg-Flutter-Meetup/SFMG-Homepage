  "aboutUsParagraph":"The Strasbourg Flutter Meetup Group is a vibrant community of Flutter enthusiasts based in and around Strasbourg. We are brought together by our shared passion for Flutter, Google's open-source UI development framework.\n\nOur group serves as a platform for developers to connect, collaborate, and learn more about Flutter.\n\nWe meet every two weeks at \"La Plage Digitale\". There we listen to presentations from our members, talk about the current status of our joint projects and solve problems together if necessary. We then end the evening with a beer together in Strasbourg's old town."
